This repository explores the intricacies of Airbnb listing prices, utilizing a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns, predict prices, and provide valuable insights for both hosts and guests. The analysis delves into a comprehensive dataset encompassing various features, such as neighborhood details, room type, minimum nights required, host information, and other relevant attributes.

Through EDA techniques, the study unveils the distribution of listings across different neighborhoods, investigates the relationship between price and other variables, and identifies potential outliers or patterns. Visualizations like scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and box plots play a crucial role in comprehending the data and highlighting significant trends or relationships. Additionally, the study employs a diverse array of machine learning models to predict Airbnb listing prices with remarkable accuracy.
